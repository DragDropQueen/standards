      SW know that computers start counting at 0.
      SW know that a negative index number counts from the end of the element.

  Constants
  Arrays
    Array-like classes (e.g. Set)
  Ranges
  Hashes
  Symbols
    SW understand the equal symbols are stored in the same place in memory (line integers, unlike strings)
  Blocks

  Conditionals
    If/elsif/else
      1-line if statement
      ternary
    While
    Unless
    defined?
  Boolean Logic
    True/truthy, false/falsy
    Comparison operators
      <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
      .equal? vs. .eql?
      SW know that comparison operators return true or false.

      #to_s
      #to_a
      #to_hash
      #to_h
      #to_int (and the difference between it and #to_i)
      #to_ary (and the difference between it and #to_a)
      #to_str (and the difference between it and #to_s)
    Looping methods
      #times
      break
    Parameters for methods
      arity
      named arguments
      splat methods
      default parameters
    String Methods
      #split with and without parameters
      #length/#size
    Enumerable methods
      SW know that enumerable methods traverse and search through collections.
      #each
        SW know that the each method is the base for all enumerable methods but that it should be used infrequently.
        SW know that the return value for each is the original collection.
      iterating over collection
        #map/#collect
        #reduce/#inject
          SW know that reduce/inject combines the elements in a collection.
        #sort_by
      filtering a collection
        #select
        #detect
        #min & #max
        #reject
        #find
          SW know that find is a method used on collections.
          SW know that find returns the first element that meets a specified criteria.
      others
        #count
          SW know that count is a method used on collections.
          SW know that count returns the number of elements that meet a specified criteria.
        #reduce/#inject
          SW know that inject/reduce is a method used on collections.
          SW know that
        #zip
          SW know that zip is a method used on arrays.
          SW know that zip produces a 2D array by pairing elements at the same index position in two or more starting arrays.
        #group_by
          SW know that group_by returns a hash.
          SW know that the keys of the returned hash are the results of the block and the values are arrays of the original elements.
    Predicate methods
      SW know that a predicate method is written "___?" and returns true or false.
      #none?
        SW know that none? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks that no elements meet a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #one?
        SW know that one? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks to see if exactly one element meets a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #all?
        SW know that all? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks to see if every element meets a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #any?
        SW know that any? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks for an element in an array that meets specified criteria and returns true or false.
