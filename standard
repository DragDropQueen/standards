  Basics
    Index numbers
      SW know that computers start counting at 0.
      SW know that a negative index number counts from the end of the element.

    Substrings with #slice/word[]
    Interpolation
      "#{}"
      "" + variable + ""

  Boolean Logic
    True/truthy, false/falsy
    Comparison operators
      <, >, <=, >=, ==, !=
      SW know that comparison operators return true or false.
    Logical operators
      &&, ||
  Methods
    Changing class
      #to_i
      #to_f
      #to_s
      #to_a
      #to_hash
    Looping methods
      #times
      break
    Parameters for methods
    String Methods
      #split with and without parameters
      #length/#size
    Enumerable methods
      SW know that enumerable methods traverse and search through collections.
      #each
        SW know that the each method is the base for all enumerable methods but that it should be used infrequently.
      iterating over collection
        #map/#collect
        #inject
        #sort_by
      filtering a collection
        #select
        #detect
        #min & #max
        #reject
        #find
          SW know that find is a method used on collections.
          SW know that find returns the first element that meets a specified criteria.
      others
        #count
        #reduce/#inject
        #zip
        #group_by
          SW know that group_by returns a hash.
          SW know that the keys of the returned hash are the results of the block and the values are arrays of the original elements.
    Predicate methods
      SW know that a predicate method is written "___?" and returns true or false.
      #none?
        SW know that none? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks that no elements meet a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #one?
        SW know that one? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks to see if exactly one element meets a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #all?
        SW know that all? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks to see if every element meets a specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #any?
        SW know that any? is a method used on collections.
        SW know that this method checks for an element in an array that meets specified criteria and returns true or false.
      #include?
  Variables
    naming conventions
    assignment vs. comparison
    reassignment
    change and reassign value by increment (+=, -=, *=, /=)

  Style Best Practices
    indentation
  irb
  bundler
  installing gems
  using gems
  APIs
  Finding code
    (gem which)
    which
    pry show-source
    method.source_location
  reflection
  using documentation
Thinking
  read that debugging thing
Git
  initialize a repository
  adding files (all vs. one at a time)
  adding remote
  Committing code
    commit message conventions
      start with present-tense verb
  Pushing code
Testing
  Best Practices
    first write test that will fail
    run tests to show failure
    implement smallest possible change to make test pass
